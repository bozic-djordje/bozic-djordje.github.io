With the recent active interest in the unsupervised learning paradigm in the RL research community, the option framework was adapted to utilize the concept of empowerment, which corresponds to the amount of influence the agent has on the environment and it's ability to perceive this influence, and which can be optimized without any supervision provided by the environment's reward structure. Many recent papers modify this concept in various ways achieving commendable results. Through these various modifications, however, the initial context of empowerment is often lost. In this work we offer a comparative study of such papers through the lens of the original empowerment principle."}],"interests":[{"name":"Research","icon":"fa-solid fa-laptop","keywords":["Reinforcement Learning","Machine Learning","Hierarchical RL","Intrinsic Motivation","Symbol Grounding","Learning Representations","Continual Learning"]},{"name":"Personal","icon":"fa-solid fa-thumbtack","keywords":["Reading","Sci-Fi","Brutalism","Film","Board Games","Running","Fencing"]}],"skills":[{"name":"Programming","icon":"fa-solid fa-hashtag","keywords":["Python","PyTorch","TensorFlow 2","OpenCV","C++","Software Design","UML"]}],"languages":[{"language":"Serbian","fluency":"Native speaker","icon":""},{"language":"English","fluency":"Fluent","icon":""},{"language":"Russian","fluency":"Understands Only","icon":""}]}
